# Have the function NumberSearch(str) take the str parameter, search for all the numbers in the string, add them
# together, then return that final number divided by the total amount of letters in the string. For example: if str is
# "Hello6 9World 2, Nic8e D7ay!" the output should be 2. First if you add up all the numbers, 6 + 9 + 2 + 8 + 7 you get
# 32. Then there are 17 letters in the string. 32 / 17 = 1.882, and the final answer should be rounded to the nearest
# whole number, so the answer is 2. Only single digit numbers separated by spaces will be used throughout the whole
# string (So this won't ever be the case: hello44444 world). Each string will also have at least one letter.


def NumberSearch(a_str):
    num_total = 0

    for char in a_str:
        if char in "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz":
            num_letters += 1
        elif char in "0123456789":
            num_total += int(char)
